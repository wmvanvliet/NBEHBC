    " 1. Run a code cell\n",
    " 1. Use a variable\n",
    " 1. Call a Python function\n",

I'll be oversimplifying things a little to shield you from some underlying complexity and just give you the absolute bare minimum knowledge required to tackle the exercise during the lecture.

    "\n",
    "Good news! The majority of all the code you'll ever need is already written for you by others. You just have to know how to use it.\n",
    "The most common way to re-use code that other people wrote is to call Python functions.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "max(10, 42)  # Produces 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often, a function will produce a result. In programming lingo, we say it \"returns\" a result. For example `max(10, 42)` will return `42`. Unless we assign this result to a variable, it gets lost. So here is a more useful example of using the `max` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "max_value = max(10, 42)  # Assigns 42 to the max_value variable\n",
    "```\n",

    "Functions can have optional parameters, that you can specify, but if you don't, they have a default value assigned that will be used instead. By convention, you specify optional parameters using `parameter=value`:\n",
